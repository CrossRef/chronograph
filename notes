Interesting things

Well, the DOI Chronograph has been running for a few weeks. Since launch we've piled a load more information into it and it now contains:

- date of publication
- date that the publisher first deposited metadata with us
- if there are CrossMark updates for a DOI, the dates that those updates were published
- the date that it was first possible to resolve a DOI (from mid-January onward). We have a robot checking new publications as they are published.
- where we have logs, the date on which the first successful resolution was made
- if the DOI was cited from Wikipedia, the date on which it was added (from mid-January onward)

We learned some pretty interesting things along the way

GitHub changed domains

Ian Mulvaney on twitter asked

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joewass">@joewass</a> whatâ€™s up with github? <a href="http://t.co/NciIGBaX1S">http://t.co/NciIGBaX1S</a></p>&mdash; Ian Mulvany (@IanMulvany) <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMulvany/status/555051365517770752">January 13, 2015</a></blockquote>

So I had a look.
